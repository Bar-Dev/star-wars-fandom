# UX

With the latest Star Wars films released over the last few years it has grabbed the attention of newer audiences wanting to know what the whole Star Wars Saga is about. The Star Wars Fandom website was designed for that purpose, to give new audiences an unbiased look over the entire Star Wars series from the eyes of other people. 
The UX was laid out with the specific goal to be about the reviews of other people, generate a friendly community and to cover:

1. What Films have been covered by the reviews. 
2. What did people who reviewed them think of the films?
3. The ability to be able to add their own reviews. 

The website is designed to give the user the aim of been able to view others reviews, create their own reviews, edit only their own work and delete their own reviews should they wish. In addition they have the ability to crete their own user profile, select/change a profile image and select/change what side of the "Force" they chose to be on.

## Wireframes

With the help of [figma](https://www.figma.com/) I produced mockups of the proposed website starting with a mobile first approach.

Links to the mockups can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/gk8v8WA3ndCOmjdplOmE7x/Star-Wars-Fandom?node-id=0%3A1) where you will find the full design 
proposal for each page. 

If you cannot access the mockups via the link above you can view them [here](https://github.com/Bar-Dev/star-wars-fandom/tree/master/documentation/wireframes)

## The Design

As you can see from the Wireframes there was a few other elements I wanted to add to the website however due to their complexity I've decided to leave these for further updates and add-ons in the future.
For now I toned things back and went for a more minimalistic approach to give the user a good feel of what the website is about and keeping it specifically to film reviews. By generating a fan base and followers now to the website I believe the additional items such as the Chat-Room and Memorabilia displays will be more welcome in the future and keep peoples attention to an ever evolving site.
